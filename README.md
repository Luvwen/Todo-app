Hi, im Santiago and this is my todo app.

This app was developed using Reactjs and the useReducer hook to manage the states.

Here you cand add, delete, toggle between done/undone tasks and you can also view the day and quantity of tasks actives.

Its not finished because i have planned to make it responsive and add buttons to switch between completed/uncompleted tasks as well as been able to see the hour of the creation of the task.
